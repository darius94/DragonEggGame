    /*Decorator explained: is like adding things on top of a defined thing. can add something that will change a characteristic of an object without changing the object. Can give the item and concatenate the the different things and give the values.
     with delegate you have 1
     but with decorator you can have multiple

    /*
    notification center where seperate objects send there info without directly contacting one another
    can be done in swift because language is message passing most other languages arent
    */
    /*
    design Pattern Facade: simplifies the interface and you can request something in the background
    ex: like picking a pizza without telling your toppings. like a hot and ready-pep from little caesars
    if i create another connect like :connect with regular lock it doesnt say what kind of lock in Door class . if it was a func connect with regular lock , it makes it with automatically with regular lock. can be added just like function at bottom of door.its a simple way of creating something complex
